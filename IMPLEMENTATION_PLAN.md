# Oahu Transit Hub - Complete GTFS Implementation Plan

## Current Problems
1. **Fake Data**: Using hardcoded bus stops instead of real GTFS data
2. **No Trip Planning**: TheBus API doesn't provide trip planning - we need to build it
3. **Wrong Routes**: System suggests walking to transit centers instead of nearby stops
4. **No Real-Time**: Not integrating with TheBus real-time arrivals API

## Solution Architecture

### Phase 1: GTFS Data Integration (Immediate)
1. Download GTFS feed from https://www.thebus.org/transitdata/production/google_transit.zip
2. Parse essential files:
   - `stops.txt` - All bus stop locations
   - `routes.txt` - All bus routes
   - `stop_times.txt` - Schedule data
   - `trips.txt` - Trip information
   - `calendar.txt` - Service days

3. Store in database with spatial indexing for fast queries

### Phase 2: Real Stop Finding
1. Use actual GTFS stops data
2. Spatial queries to find nearest stops within walking distance
3. Consider directional stops (same location, different directions)

### Phase 3: Trip Planning Algorithm
1. Find nearest stops to origin and destination
2. Search for direct routes between stops
3. If no direct routes, find transfer options through hubs
4. Rank by total time, transfers, and walking distance

### Phase 4: Real-Time Integration
1. Use TheBus API for real-time arrivals
2. Enhance planned trips with live data
3. Show vehicle positions when available

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create GTFS Processor Service
```typescript
// Downloads and parses GTFS data
// Updates database with latest stops, routes, schedules
```

### Step 2: Create Stop Finder Service
```typescript
// Finds nearest stops using PostGIS spatial queries
// Returns walking time and distance
```

### Step 3: Create Trip Planner Service
```typescript
// Implements Dijkstra-based routing algorithm
// Handles transfers and time-based routing
```

### Step 4: Integrate Real-Time Data
```typescript
// Enhances static GTFS with TheBus real-time API
// Shows live arrivals and delays
```

## Database Schema

```sql
-- Core GTFS tables with spatial indexing
gtfs_stops (with PostGIS GEOGRAPHY column)
gtfs_routes
gtfs_trips
gtfs_stop_times
gtfs_calendar
```

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/transit/plan` - Plan a trip using real GTFS data
- `GET /api/transit/stops/nearby` - Find nearby stops
- `GET /api/transit/arrivals/:stopId` - Get real-time arrivals
- `GET /api/transit/vehicle/:vehicleId` - Track vehicle location

## Caching Strategy

1. Cache GTFS data for 24 hours
2. Update nightly at 2 AM
3. Cache trip plans for 5 minutes
4. Real-time data not cached

## Testing

1. Verify stop finding accuracy (should find stops within 800m)
2. Test trip planning between major locations
3. Validate transfer logic
4. Ensure real-time updates work

## Timeline

- **Day 1**: Download and parse GTFS data
- **Day 2**: Implement stop finding with real data
- **Day 3**: Build trip planning algorithm
- **Day 4**: Integrate real-time data
- **Day 5**: Testing and optimization

## Success Metrics

1. ✅ Find actual nearby bus stops (not transit centers)
2. ✅ Accurate trip planning with real schedules
3. ✅ Show real-time arrivals
4. ✅ Support transfers when needed
5. ✅ Walking time under 10 minutes to stops
